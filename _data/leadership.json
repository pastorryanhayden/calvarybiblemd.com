[{"Leader_Name":"James Bussard","Content":"James Bussard grew up in Sharpsburg, MD in a Christian home, and accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as his Savior at Camp Tohiglo in Mercersburg, PA, at the age of seven. He felt the calling of the Lord upon his life when he was eighteen years old to serve Him in full-time Christian service. He and his wife both met at and graduated from Bible college with Bachelor’s Degrees in Pastoral Ministry and Elementary Education respectively.\n\nSarah Bussard grew up in Bowdoin, ME in a pastor’s home, and accepted Christ as her Savior in 2002. She met her husband, James, at Bible college, recognized God’s involvement in their relationship, and were married in June 2003. The Lord has since blessed them with three children: Phoebe (born 2004), Jimmy (born 2006), and Andrea (born 2007). They are thankful that all three of their children have made solid professions of faith.\n\nOn May 29, 2016, Calvary Bible Church called James to be their pastor. He and his family moved to the church property that same week. James was previously the pastor of Heritage Park Baptist Church of Woodsboro, MD for several years, and has prior years' experience in teaching, preaching, and music, amongst other church ministries. He has also developed several discipleship and Bible study books, to help believers grow in their relationship with Jesus Christ.\n\nJames, Sarah, and their family are excited to be a part of Calvary Bible Church. They believe that the church exists for the purpose of doing the work of Jesus Christ on Earth, until His coming. This means that we work hard to preach the Gospel to the unsaved, disciple the saved, and do good works in Christ's name. Therefore, church services are geared towards equipping the saints to do the work of the ministry through conservative, God-honoring music, prayer, the expository preaching of God’s Word, fellowship, and other biblical forms of worship.","Position":"Pastor","Is_Senior_Pastor":true}]
